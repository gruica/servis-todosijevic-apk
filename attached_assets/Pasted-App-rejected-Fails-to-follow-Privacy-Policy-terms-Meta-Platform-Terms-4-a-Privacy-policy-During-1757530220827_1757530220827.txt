Unable to Verify Use Case Experience in App
Developer Policy 1.6 - Build a trustworthy product
We were unable to verify the use case outlined in your notes and screencast when we logged in to review your app.
To help resolve this issue, please consider the following recommendations.
Check that your app is fully developed and has correctly integrated the requested permission before re-submitting for review.
Provide correct test credentials to access your app in a test environment or development mode. Development mode allows your app to access permission/feature with limited test data for App Review.
If your app is in live mode/published, you must create a test app for your live/published app to create an App Review submission without compromising the functionality of the cloned parent app.
Please provide a correct test URL in your submission notes. This will enable us to access the testing environment of your app. For web-based platforms, please use our debugger to verify that our reviewers can access the URL.
Please make sure that app asks the permissions from the user before accessing user's data.
