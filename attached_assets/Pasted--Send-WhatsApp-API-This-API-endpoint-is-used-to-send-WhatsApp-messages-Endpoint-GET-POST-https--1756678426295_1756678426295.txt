Authentication
 
The SMSMobile API supports two authentication methods: using a simple API Key or the OAuth2 protocol with a client ID and client secret.

1. API Key Authentication  

To send or retrieve WhatsApp messages via our API, authentication is required using an API key. This ensures secure and authorized access to the messaging service. Simply include your API key in the request to authenticate and start sending messages seamlessly.

2. OAuth2 Authentication

OAuth2 provides a more secure and scalable authentication method.
You will need to use a client ID and client secret to obtain an access token, which should then be included in your API requests using the Authorization header.

The client_id and client_secret are available in your dashboard.

Obtaining an Access Token

To get an access token, send a POST request to the token endpoint with your client ID and client secret.

curl -X POST https://api.smsmobileapi.com/oauth2/token \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
-d "client_id=1ab0ex4b4c1ef2c800690d" \
-d "client_secret=3ed108a93d0414074b94364290b6a7348475e93a0567005"

Using the Access Token:

Once you have the access token, include it in the Authorization header of your API requests:

curl -X POST https://api.smsmobileapi.com/sendsms?waonly=yes \
-H "Authorization: Bearer abc123xyz456" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "recipients=+1234567890" \
-d "message=Hello"

Which Method Should You Use?

- Use API Key Authentication for quick and straightforward integrations.

- Use OAuth2 Authentication for enhanced security and scalability in your integrations.


It is also possible to send a WhatsApp message and an SMS simultaneously.
