**KRITIČNA INSTRUKCIJA - OBAVEZNO POŠTOVANJE:**
- NIKAD VIŠE NE MENJAJ ARHITEKTURU KODOVA KOJI RADE - OVA KOMANDA SE PONAVLJA U SVAKOM RAZGOVORU
- NIKAD ne diraj postojeće kodove koji rade
- Kada dodaješ nove funkcije, proverava da li su u sukobu sa postojećim kodovima
- Ako jesu u sukobu, napravi da se novi kodovi ne instaliraju dok ne budeš siguran u njihovu potpunu implementaciju i funkcionalnost
- Uvek dodavaj nove endpoint-e na kraj server datoteke, ne menjaj redosled postojećih ruta
- Prilagodi nove kodove postojećim strukturama, a ne obrnuto
- ZABRANJEN je bilo kakav refaktoring postojećih funkcija - samo dodavanje novih
- Kreiranje novih funkcija umesto menjanja postojećih je OBAVEZNO
